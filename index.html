	<p>Textures and patterns. I tend to collect textures and patterns, usually little fragments of scenes. This utility grate with multiple layers of paint is a favorite of mine. I sometimes call this Very Low Altitude Aerial Photography, since you can look straight down from about a foot or two high and see some interesting things — without renting a chopper.

Side note: only when I put this image side by side with Nicole, with her eyes, did I realize that the little diamond shapes also look like eyes — context makes a big difference.</p>
